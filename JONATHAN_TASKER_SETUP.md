# Jonathan's Tasker Setup - Human Conversation Logging

This setup captures ALL SMS conversations (incoming and outgoing) from Jonathan's phone and logs them to the database.

## 🎯 Purpose

When Jonathan takes over customer conversations, this system:
- ✅ Logs all customer messages to the database
- ✅ Logs all Jonathan's replies to the database  
- ✅ Maintains complete conversation history
- ✅ Allows AI to resume with full context later

## 📱 Setup Instructions

### Profile 1: Incoming SMS (Customer → Jonathan)

**Step 1: Create Incoming SMS Profile**
1. Open Tasker → **Profiles** → **+**
2. Select **Event** → **Phone** → **Received Text**
3. Leave **Sender** blank
4. Name: **"Log Incoming SMS"**

**Step 2: Create Incoming SMS Task**
1. Create task: **"Log Customer Message"**
2. Add Action: **Net** → **HTTP Request**

```
Server:Port: thedistillerynetwork.onrender.com
Path: /human
Method: POST
Content Type: application/json
Body: {
  "phone": "%SMSRF",
  "text": "%SMSRB",
  "type": "incoming"
}
Timeout: 10
```

### Profile 2: Outgoing SMS (Jonathan → Customer)

}

```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Customer sends SMS to Jonathan:
```
Customer: "Hi Jonathan, my still isn't heating properly"
↓
Tasker detects incoming SMS
↓  
Logs to database as: sender="user", message="Hi Jonathan, my still isn't heating properly"
```

### Jonathan replies:
```
Jonathan: "Let me check - did you connect the heating element properly?"
↓
Tasker detects outgoing SMS
↓
Logs to database as: sender="assistant", message="Let me check - did you connect the heating element properly?"
```

## 🎛️ Advanced Configuration

### Add Error Handling
After each HTTP Request action, add:

**Error Check Action:**
- **Variables** → **Variable Set**
- Name: `%LogResult`
- To: `%HTTPR`
- **If**: `%LogResult !~ 200`
- Add **Alert**: "Failed to log SMS"

### Add Success Confirmation (Optional)
- **Alert** → **Flash**  
- Text: `SMS logged ✓`
- Long: No

### Filter Specific Numbers (Optional)
In SMS profiles, set **Sender/Number** to specific customer numbers if you only want to log certain conversations.

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Incoming:

3. Should appear as: sender="user"

### Test Outgoing:  
1. Jonathan replies to any SMS
