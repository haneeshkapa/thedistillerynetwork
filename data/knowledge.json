We only use high grade, heavy gauge copper. Our products are durable and built to last a lifetime!\nWhat Can You Accomplish With Our Stills?\n What can't you do is the question! Our stills are an essential versatile part of any household. Here are just a few of the things you can do with one of our stills:\n\n\nPurify Your Own Water\n\n\nHave your own water source? Want to make your home self-sufficient? Then a still is a must! You can easily take water from any source and use our still to make clean distilled water that's safe to drink.\n\n\n\nMoonshine, Liquor, and Spirit Distillation\n\n\nEthanol Fuel Gas Production\n\n\nEssential Oils And Perfume Production\n\n\nMeat And Poultry Marinades\n\n\nAnd More! \n\n\n\n \nAll of our units are sold in terms of CAPACITY, this means that if it is listed as a 10 gallon moonshine still, that means you can fill it up with 10 gallons of mash, which will end up giving you whatever your alcohol content is inside the pot.  Example, if you have a 10 gallon pot, and 10% alcohol by volume in your mash, and you distill it, you will end up getting 1 gallon of pure liquor.   Please also note, just because it says \"moonshine still\" doesn't mean it only makes moonshine.  These units make a VERY wide range of spirits.  As well as so much more.\n \nTHIS UNIT COMES WITH THE STAINLESS EZ SEAL CAP AND 4 INCH FRUIT PORT ON THE THUMPER.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s talk about your first or last Made In America Copper Moonshine Still.  \n \nCall Us  OR TEXT US 24/7\n1-502-337-3944\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are available to answer your questions so please contact us:\n\n\nCall Us  OR TEXT US 24/7\n1-502-337-394 \n\n\nAmerican Copper Works operates 5 locations across the east coast located in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA who builds moonshine stills and ships them world wide.  If you are close to one of these states please let us know if you want to receive your order from our shops in NH, TN, KY, NC, or GA.  We are happy to offer you the service of customer pick up but also a more personalized and custom order experience.  Please reach out directly to our sales representative and ask for more information by calling  1-502-337-3944 and pressing 1.   We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.THIS UNIT COMES WITH THE STAINLESS EZ SEAL CAP AND 4 INCH FRUIT PORT ON THE THUMPER.\n \n  These two add ons make your unit more efficient and effective.  The easy seal cap makes it so you don’t need to apply wheat or flour paste on the pot to seal it every time.  You wont need to clean up any messy paste because you will have a food safe silicone gasket and a stainless steel butterfly clamp and 4 inch stainless ferrule added on the top of your pot.  This way you can seal your unit for the distillation process by a clamping system instead of the old school paste method.  Sealing it this way is highly efficient.  You can also add on the 4 inch port on the thumper as well.  It’s the same set up, 4 inch tri clamp, 4 inch gasket, 4 inch stainless ferrule and 4 inch stainless cap but this time it’s installed on the top of the thumper so you can infuse different flavors into your product.  Having the 4 inch port added on to the thumper also makes it a lot easier to clean the thumper when you decide to run different flavors through the distiller. \nIf you want to make sure your order has these add ons or any other custom requests please call 1-502-337-3944 and press 1.  We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.\n\nLIFETIME WARRANTY.  Completely Made in USA.

The Thumper is 9\" by12\" cylindrically and the worm is a little bit bigger.  The coil is 3/8 coil and the tubing is 1/2 inch tube. The thickness of the copper used is 20 oz. / 22 gauge copper sheet purchased from Paul Revere out of Boston Mass which is 99.9% pure copper. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow To Set Up The Moonshine Still \n\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n \n1. Open your box.\n \n2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n \n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n \n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n \n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\n \nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n \n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n \n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n \n9. MASH= Fermented materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\n \nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, because it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n \n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n \n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n \n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n \n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit.

Open your box.\n2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n9. MASH= Fermented Materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, because it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL. \n \n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAmerican Copper Works operates 5 locations across the east coast located in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA who builds moonshine stills and ships them world wide.  If you are close to one of these states please let us know if you want to receive your order from our shops in NH, TN, KY, NC, or GA.  We are happy to offer you the service of customer pick up but also a more personalized and custom order experience.  Please reach out directly to our sales representative and ask for more information by calling  1-502-337-3944 and pressing 1.   We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you. Our units can be upgraded with an ez seal cap on the pot as well as a 4 inch port on the thumper.  These two add ons are optional and not mandatory.  These two add ons make your unit more efficient and effective.  The easy seal cap makes it so you don’t need to apply wheat or flour paste on the pot to seal it every time.  You wont need to clean up any messy paste because you will have a food safe silicone gasket and a stainless steel butterfly clamp and 4 inch stainless ferrule added on the top of your pot.  This way you can seal your unit for the distillation process by a clamping system instead of the old school paste method.  Sealing it this way is highly efficient.  You can also add on the 4 inch port on the thumper as well.  It’s the same set up, 4 inch tri clamp, 4 inch gasket, 4 inch stainless ferrule and 4 inch stainless cap but this time it’s installed on the top of the thumper so you can infuse different flavors into your product.  Having the 4 inch port added on to the thumper also makes it a lot easier to clean the thumper when you decide to run different flavors through the distiller.  If you see the words “top end” model on any of our websites, that is the model with the ez seal cap and 4 inch port on the thumper.  If you want to make sure your order has these add ons or any other custom requests please call 1-502-337-3944 and press 1.  We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.\n \nLIFETIME WARRANTY.  Completely Made in USA.

You can easily set up your own home distillery. \nA copper still could save your life, so, go ahead and brew some moonshine. This is a true Appalachian pot still.

Open your box.\n2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n9. MASH= Fermented materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, because it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAmerican Copper Works operates 5 locations across the east coast located in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA who builds moonshine stills and ships them world wide.  If you are close to one of these states please let us know if you want to receive your order from our shops in NH, TN, KY, NC, or GA.  We are happy to offer you the service of customer pick up but also a more personalized and custom order experience.  Please reach out directly to our sales representative and ask for more information by calling  1-502-337-3944 and pressing 1.   We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.

Open your box.\n2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n9. MASH= Fermented materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, because it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL. \n \n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAmerican Copper Works operates 5 locations across the east coast located in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA who builds moonshine stills and ships them world wide.  If you are close to one of these states please let us know if you want to receive your order from our shops in NH, TN, KY, NC, or GA.  We are happy to offer you the service of customer pick up but also a more personalized and custom order experience.  Please reach out directly to our sales representative and ask for more information by calling  1-502-337-3944 and pressing 1.   We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you. Our units can be upgraded with an ez seal cap on the pot as well as a 4 inch port on the thumper.  These two add ons are optional and not mandatory.  These two add ons make your unit more efficient and effective.  The easy seal cap makes it so you don’t need to apply wheat or flour paste on the pot to seal it every time.  You wont need to clean up any messy paste because you will have a food safe silicone gasket and a stainless steel butterfly clamp and 4 inch stainless ferrule added on the top of your pot.  This way you can seal your unit for the distillation process by a clamping system instead of the old school paste method.  Sealing it this way is highly efficient.  You can also add on the 4 inch port on the thumper as well.  It’s the same set up, 4 inch tri clamp, 4 inch gasket, 4 inch stainless ferrule and 4 inch stainless cap but this time it’s installed on the top of the thumper so you can infuse different flavors into your product.  Having the 4 inch port added on to the thumper also makes it a lot easier to clean the thumper when you decide to run different flavors through the distiller.  If you see the words “top end” model on any of our websites, that is the model with the ez seal cap and 4 inch port on the thumper.  If you want to make sure your order has these add ons or any other custom requests please call 1-502-337-3944 and press 1.  We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.\n\nLIFETIME WARRANTY.  Completely Made in USA.

Our units are proudly handmade in the USA, tested to be leak-proof, and backed by an unmatched lifetime warranty. We operate five locations across the East Coast in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA, offering customer pickup and personalized service.\nWe are passionate about providing top-tier products for both beginners and seasoned distillers. Check out our full line of copper stills and distilling accessories to find the perfect setup for your needs.\nAssembly Instructions &amp; How to Use Your Still\nUnbox your kit and lay out all parts. Position the pot on a sturdy surface with the temperature gauge facing left. Place the thumper and worm to the right of the pot. Attach the cap by aligning the seams and spinning the fittings to the left side of the thumper. Use thread-locking tape or wheat paste if needed for a tight seal, but the EZ Seal Cap minimizes mess and fuss.\nAttach hoses to the worm coil for a constant flow of cool water—ice water is best for optimal condensation. Fill your pot with strained mash (fermented material ranging between 1% and 35% ABV). Use a hydrometer to measure alcohol content; this tool is essential for quality control.\nLight your burner or power up your electric heating element beneath the pot. As distillation starts, monitor the worm output and record the temperature. Keep the still within the “operating range” (20°F above the initial drip temperature) to avoid water contamination. Empty the thumper regularly to prevent shutdown, and always discard the first and last portions of your distillate for safety.\nNeed recipes?

You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n \n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n \n9. MASH= Fermented materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\n \nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, because it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n \n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n \n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n \n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n \n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \n \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL. \n\n\n \n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n \nAmerican Copper Works operates 5 locations across the east coast located in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA who builds moonshine stills and ships them world wide.  If you are close to one of these states please let us know if you want to receive your order from our shops in NH, TN, KY, NC, or GA.  We are happy to offer you the service of customer pick up but also a more personalized and custom order experience.  Please reach out directly to our sales representative and ask for more information by calling  1-502-337-3944 and pressing 1.   We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you. Our units can be upgraded with an ez seal cap on the pot as well as a 4 inch port on the thumper.  These two add ons are optional and not mandatory.  These two add ons make your unit more efficient and effective.  The easy seal cap makes it so you don’t need to apply wheat or flour paste on the pot to seal it every time.  You wont need to clean up any messy paste because you will have a food safe silicone gasket and a stainless steel butterfly clamp and 4 inch stainless ferrule added on the top of your pot.  This way you can seal your unit for the distillation process by a clamping system instead of the old school paste method.  Sealing it this way is highly efficient.  You can also add on the 4 inch port on the thumper as well.  It’s the same set up, 4 inch tri clamp, 4 inch gasket, 4 inch stainless ferrule and 4 inch stainless cap but this time it’s installed on the top of the thumper so you can infuse different flavors into your product.  Having the 4 inch port added on to the thumper also makes it a lot easier to clean the thumper when you decide to run different flavors through the distiller.  If you see the words “top end” model on any of our websites, that is the model with the ez seal cap and 4 inch port on the thumper.  If you want to make sure your order has these add ons or any other custom requests please call 1-502-337-3944 and press 1.  We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.\n\n\nShipping\n\nFree Shipping to Continental USA.  Worldwide Shipping Available. \n\nLIFETIME WARRANTY.  Completely Made in USA.

Sheet copper which is cut,  bent,  rolled and in embossed which leaves it ready to solder.  Clamping and Soldering  of the pieces is what is needed to complete the moonshine still. \nThis is not a project where you just solder the tubing pieces and you're done. This is a project that will take at least 4 to 8 hours to complete. When we get the copper in our shop,  we measure it,  cut it, bend it, roll it into a cylinder shape,  emboss it and ship it to the customer ready to clamp and solder. \n \nWe include the flux and solder in the box as well as all the parts and fittings that you need to finish the unit. We do not include the propane tank the torch head for the propane tank. \n \nYou can save a bunch of money with our moonshine kits. We specialize in 2 gallon kits all the way up to 100 gallon moonshine kits where the customer can actually save themselves hundreds of dollars.\n \nOnce again this project is not easy.

Our units can be upgraded with an ez seal cap on the pot as well as a 4 inch port on the thumper.  These two add ons are optional and not mandatory.  These two add ons make your unit more efficient and effective.  The easy seal cap makes it so you don’t need to apply wheat or flour paste on the pot to seal it every time.  You wont need to clean up any messy paste because you will have a food safe silicone gasket and a stainless steel butterfly clamp and 4 inch stainless ferrule added on the top of your pot.  This way you can seal your unit for the distillation process by a clamping system instead of the old school paste method.  Sealing it this way is highly efficient.  You can also add on the 4 inch port on the thumper as well.  It’s the same set up, 4 inch tri clamp, 4 inch gasket, 4 inch stainless ferrule and 4 inch stainless cap but this time it’s installed on the top of the thumper so you can infuse different flavors into your product.  Having the 4 inch port added on to the thumper also makes it a lot easier to clean the thumper when you decide to run different flavors through the distiller.  If you see the words “top end” model on any of our websites, that is the model with the ez seal cap and 4 inch port on the thumper.  If you want to make sure your order has these add ons or any other custom requests please call 1-502-337-3944 and press 1.  We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.\n \n\nLIFETIME WARRANTY.  Completely Made in USA.

Sheet copper which is cut,  bent,  rolled and in embossed which leaves it ready to solder.  Clamping and Soldering  of the pieces is what is needed to complete the moonshine still. \n\nThis is not a project where you just solder the tubing pieces and you're done. This is a project that will take at least 4 to 8 hours to complete. When we get the copper in our shop,  we measure it,  cut it, bend it, roll it into a cylinder shape,  emboss it and ship it to the customer ready to clamp and solder. \n \nWe include the flux and solder in the box as well as all the parts and fittings that you need to finish the unit. We do not include the propane tank the torch head for the propane tank. \n \nYou can save a bunch of money with our moonshine kits. We specialize in 2 gallon kits all the way up to 100 gallon moonshine kits where the customer can actually save themselves hundreds of dollars.\n \nOnce again this project is not easy. We estimate that it will take the average customer 4 to 8 hours to clamp and solder and complete the unit. You can check out our video on www.moonshinekits.com which is a 36 minute tutorial video as well as you can check out \"KitBookLet) Which is an instruction booklet built for our customers. Thank you for being a part of American Copper Works.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHow to build a 25 Gallon Moonshine Still Step by Step from a Home Distilling Kit \n\n\nClick here to gain access to our moonshine kit booklet (Bookitlet) page\n\n\n\n\n\nClick below to get access to a pdf very own moonshine kit booklet (Bookitlet)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPlease check out the complete description of each of our sizes on our websites. For example if you are interested in a 6 gallon DIY Kit and are wondering the measurements of a 6 gallon Moonshine Still you can check out our listing on any of our websites to see the specific measurements and specifications of the 6 gallon unit. \n \n\nPlease keep in mind that all of our units come with the Upgraded Thumper and Worm kit. The Thumper is 9\" by 9\" cylindrically and the worm is a little bit bigger.  The coil is 3/8 coil and the tubing is 1/2 inch tube. The thickness of the copper used is 20 oz. / 22 gauge copper sheet purchased from Paul Revere out of Boston Mass which is 99.9% pure.\n\n\nAll models are our base models, the same ones we have been building for the past 14 years.   Over the years we have developed add-ons which we know you will love.  Let’s talk about your first or last Made In America Copper Moonshine Still.  \n1-502-337-3944 – Call Us 24/7\n\nShipping\n\nFree Shipping to Continental USA.  Worldwide Shipping Available. \n\n\n  \nPutting together your 25 Gallon Moonshine Still \n\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n \n1. Open your box.\n \n2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n \n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n \n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n \n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\n \nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n \n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n \n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n \n9. MASH= Fermented materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\n \nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, ‘cause it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n \n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n \n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant flow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n \n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n \n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \n \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL. \n\n\n \n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAmerican Copper Works operates 5 locations across the east coast located in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA who builds moonshine stills and ships them world wide.  If you are close to one of these states please let us know if you want to receive your order from our shops in NH, TN, KY, NC, or GA.  We are happy to offer you the service of customer pick up but also a more personalized and custom order experience.  Please reach out directly to our sales representative and ask for more information by calling  1-502-337-3944 and pressing 1.   We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.

Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL. \n \n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAmerican Copper Works operates 5 locations across the east coast located in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA who builds moonshine stills and ships them world wide.  If you are close to one of these states please let us know if you want to receive your order from our shops in NH, TN, KY, NC, or GA.  We are happy to offer you the service of customer pick up but also a more personalized and custom order experience.  Please reach out directly to our sales representative and ask for more information by calling  1-502-337-3944 and pressing 1.   We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you. Our units can be upgraded with an ez seal cap on the pot as well as a 4 inch port on the thumper.  These two add ons are optional and not mandatory.  These two add ons make your unit more efficient and effective.  The easy seal cap makes it so you don’t need to apply wheat or flour paste on the pot to seal it every time.  You wont need to clean up any messy paste because you will have a food safe silicone gasket and a stainless steel butterfly clamp and 4 inch stainless ferrule added on the top of your pot.  This way you can seal your unit for the distillation process by a clamping system instead of the old school paste method.  Sealing it this way is highly efficient.  You can also add on the 4 inch port on the thumper as well.  It’s the same set up, 4 inch tri clamp, 4 inch gasket, 4 inch stainless ferrule and 4 inch stainless cap but this time it’s installed on the top of the thumper so you can infuse different flavors into your product.  Having the 4 inch port added on to the thumper also makes it a lot easier to clean the thumper when you decide to run different flavors through the distiller.  If you see the words “top end” model on any of our websites, that is the model with the ez seal cap and 4 inch port on the thumper.  If you want to make sure your order has these add ons or any other custom requests please call 1-502-337-3944 and press 1.  We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.\n\n\nShipping\n\nFree Shipping to Continental USA.  Worldwide Shipping Available. \n \nLIFETIME WARRANTY.  Completely Made in USA.

Sheet copper which is cut,  bent,  rolled and in embossed which leaves it ready to solder.  Clamping and Soldering  of the pieces is what is needed to complete the moonshine still. \nThis is not a project where you just solder the tubing pieces and you're done. This is a project that will take at least 4 to 8 hours to complete. When we get the copper in our shop,  we measure it,  cut it, bend it, roll it into a cylinder shape,  emboss it and ship it to the customer ready to clamp and solder. \n \nWe include the flux and solder in the box as well as all the parts and fittings that you need to finish the unit. We do not include the propane tank the torch head for the propane tank. \n \nYou can save a bunch of money with our moonshine kits. We specialize in 2 gallon kits all the way up to 100 gallon moonshine kits where the customer can actually save themselves hundreds of dollars.\n \nOnce again this project is not easy. We estimate that it will take the average customer 4 to 8 hours to clamp and solder and complete the unit. You can check out our video on www.moonshinekits.com which is a 36 minute tutorial video as well as you can check out \"KitBookLet) Which is an instruction booklet built for our customers.

The Thumper is 9\" by 9\" cylindrically and the worm is a little bit bigger.  The coil is 3/8 coil and the tubing is 1/2 inch tube. The thickness of the copper used is 20 oz. / 22 gauge copper sheet purchased from Paul Revere out of Boston Mass which is 99.9% pure.\n\nAll models are our base models, the same ones we have been building for the past 14 years.   Over the years we have developed add-ons which we know you will love.  Let’s talk about your first or last Made In America Copper Moonshine Still.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-502-337-3944 – Call Us 24/7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShipping\n\nFree Shipping to Continental USA.  Worldwide Shipping Available. \n\n\n  \nPutting together your 30 Gallon Moonshine Still \n\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n \n1. Open your box.\n \n2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n \n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n \n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n \n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\n \nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n \n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n \n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n \n9. MASH= Fermented materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\n \nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, ‘cause it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n \n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing.

Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n9. MASH= Fermented Materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, because it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL.\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Copper Works operates 5 locations across the east coast located in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA who builds moonshine stills and ships them world wide.  If you are close to one of these states please let us know if you want to receive your order from our shops in NH, TN, KY, NC, or GA.  We are happy to offer you the service of customer pick up but also a more personalized and custom order experience.  Please reach out directly to our sales representative and ask for more information by calling  1-502-337-3944 and pressing 1.   We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you. Our units can be upgraded with an ez seal cap on the pot as well as a 4 inch port on the thumper.  These two add ons are optional and not mandatory.  These two add ons make your unit more efficient and effective.  The easy seal cap makes it so you don’t need to apply wheat or flour paste on the pot to seal it every time.  You wont need to clean up any messy paste because you will have a food safe silicone gasket and a stainless steel butterfly clamp and 4 inch stainless ferrule added on the top of your pot.  This way you can seal your unit for the distillation process by a clamping system instead of the old school paste method.  Sealing it this way is highly efficient.  You can also add on the 4 inch port on the thumper as well.  It’s the same set up, 4 inch tri clamp, 4 inch gasket, 4 inch stainless ferrule and 4 inch stainless cap but this time it’s installed on the top of the thumper so you can infuse different flavors into your product.  Having the 4 inch port added on to the thumper also makes it a lot easier to clean the thumper when you decide to run different flavors through the distiller.  If you see the words “top end” model on any of our websites, that is the model with the ez seal cap and 4 inch port on the thumper.  If you want to make sure your order has these add ons or any other custom requests please call 1-502-337-3944 and press 1.  We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.\nLIFETIME WARRANTY.  Completely Made in USA.

Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n9. MASH= Fermented Materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, because it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit.

Distilling out of a copper alcohol still is the only way to go when it comes to perfectly brewed liquor. Our liquor stills are built to last, we use only the finest 99.9% pure lead free copper sheets sourced locally in the USA. American Copper Works knows how to make stills. You can easily set up your own home distillery.\nA copper still could save your life, so, go ahead and brew some moonshine. This is a true Appalachian pot still. Call us to buy home distillery equipment from the best in the business. Have you seen the Moonshiners show? buy a moonshine still here , we have stills for sale. You can make whiskey, bourbon, rum, and much much more. \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n \n1. Open your box.\n2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n9. MASH= Fermented materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, ‘cause it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL. \n \n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n \nAmerican Copper Works operates 5 locations across the east coast located in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA who builds moonshine stills and ships them world wide.  If you are close to one of these states please let us know if you want to receive your order from our shops in NH, TN, KY, NC, or GA.  We are happy to offer you the service of customer pick up but also a more personalized and custom order experience.  Please reach out directly to our sales representative and ask for more information by calling  1-502-337-3944 and pressing 1.   We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.

For example if you are interested in a 6 gallon DIY Kit and are wondering the measurements of a 6 gallon Moonshine Still you can check out our listing on any of our websites to see the specific measurements and specifications of the 6 gallon unit. \n \n\nIncludes \"Upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit\". The Thumper is 9\" by12\" cylindrically and the worm is a little bit bigger.  The coil is 3/8 coil and the tubing is 1/2 inch tube. The thickness of the copper used is 20 oz. / 22 gauge copper sheet purchased from Paul Revere out of Boston Mass which is 99.9% pure copper. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nHow To Set Up The Moonshine Still \n\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n \n1. Open your box.\n \n2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n \n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n \n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n \n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\n \nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n \n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n \n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n \n9. MASH= Fermented materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\n \nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, because it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n \n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n \n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n \n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n \n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \n \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL.\n \n\nShipping\n\nFree Shipping to Continental USA.  Worldwide Shipping Available. \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType: DIY KIT\nVendor: American Copper Works\nURL: https://moonshine-stills-com.com/products/6-gallon-ez-kit-you-solder-copper-moonshine-kit-copy\nVariants:\n  - Default Title: $489.00 - Out of Stock\nTags: 1 gallon still, 10 gallon still for sale, 15 gallon copper moonshine still, 2 gallon still, 2 gallon stills, alcohol distillery equipment, alcohol distller, alcohol still kit, alcohol stills, amazon moonshine still, American Made Still, aromatherapy oils, brew moonshine, brewing beer, Bro, build your own brew, build your own kits, build your own stills, buy moonnshine still, cheap copper still, cheap moonshine stills, coper moonshine still, copper, copper moonshine still, copper moonshine stills, copper still, copper still moonshine, copper stills, copper stills for moonshine, copper stills for sale, copper whiskey still, cotton, craft distillery, craft distilling, dabs, distill mash, distill spirits, distillation, distillation equipment, distillation of alcohol, distillation unit, distilled ethanol, distilled spirits, distilled whiskey, distilleries, distillery, distillery equipment for sale, distillery for sale, distilling, distilling at home, distilling at house, distilling equipment, distilling liquor, distilling machine, distilling moonshine, distilling spirits at home, distilling supplies, distilling vodka, distilling water, distilling water at home, distilling wine, DIY, DIY KIT, do it yourself, Do you even lift?, ebay moonshine stills, essential oil, essential oils, home brewing, home distilled water, home distillery, home distilling, home distilling kit, home distilling supplies, home distilling supply, homemade moonshine still, how to build your own still, how to make moonshine still, liquor, liquor still, liquor stills, list essential oils, make booze at home, make moonshine still, make your own, make your own essential oils., make your own liquor, make your own liquors, memes, mens, moonshine, moonshine distillery, moonshine distilling, moonshine still, moonshine still for sale, moonshine still how to make, moonshine still kits, moonshine stilling, moonshine stillmoonshine stills for sale, moonshine stills, moonshine stills for sale, mooonshine, reflux still plans, reflux stills, Shine, SoftSpun Cotton, spirit stills for sale, stainless steel stills, stickers, still distillation, still distillations, still moonshine for sale, stills, stills for salealcohol still, survivalist, survivalists, the copper still company, where can i buy a moonshine still, whiskey still, whiskey stillmoonshine distilling, whiskey stills, whiskey stills for sale, wine making\n\n--- Flash Sale 10 Gallon Advanced Model Complete Copper Moonshine Still ---\nDescription: \n10 Gallon Advanced Model Moonshine Still -\n Complete Liquor Still with EZ Seal Cap and 4 Inch Thumper Port\nFREE SHIPPING TO CONTINENTAL USA -  PRICE INCLUDES THE SHIPPING COST\nThis is a complete moonshine still set  which includes the... POT, THUMPER, WORM, and CAP with Temperature Gauge, built with 100% lead free materials.  10 Gallon Copper Moonshine Still comes with a lifetime warranty.   The unit is ready to run, ready to put flame underneath.\nSize\nPot and Cap – 10 Gallons -  13 Inch Diameter Pot\nThumper – 3 Gallon -  9x12 inches (Upgraded Thumper)\nWorm – 3 Gallon -   9x12 inches (Upgraded Worm)\n\n\n\n\nCopper Thickness\n20 oz. 22 Gauge Pure Organic Copper Sheets (Lead Free) \n\n\n\n\n\nUses\n-Distilled, Purified Water (turn salt water into fresh water)-Moonshine and other Distilled Spirits- Essential oils and Perfumes-Antiseptic-Ethanol Gas (make your own Gas to run engines or heat your home)-Marinade for meats and poultry\n\nPlus Much, Much More!!!\n\n\nWe specialize in the manufacturing and production of COPPER MOONSHINE STILLS, which are handcrafted to perfection!  Our Moonshine Stills for sale use heavy gauge copper and our units are built to last.

Open your box.\n \n2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n \n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n \n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n \n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\n \nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n \n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n \n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n \n9. MASH= Fermented materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\n \nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, because it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n \n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n \n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n \n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n \n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \n \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL.\n \n\nShipping\n\nFree Shipping to Continental USA.  Worldwide Shipping Available. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType: DIY KIT\nVendor: American Copper Works\nURL: https://moonshine-stills-com.com/products/10-gallon-ez-kit-you-solder-copper-moonshine-kit-copy\nVariants:\n  - Default Title: $499.00 - Out of Stock\nTags: 1 gallon still, 10 gallon still for sale, 15 gallon copper moonshine still, 2 gallon still, 2 gallon stills, alcohol distillery equipment, alcohol distller, alcohol still kit, alcohol stills, amazon moonshine still, American Made Still, aromatherapy oils, brew moonshine, brewing beer, Bro, build your own brew, build your own kits, build your own stills, buy moonnshine still, cheap copper still, cheap moonshine stills, coper moonshine still, copper, copper moonshine still, copper moonshine stills, copper still, copper still moonshine, copper stills, copper stills for moonshine, copper whiskey still, cotton, craft distillery, craft distilling, dabs, distill mash, distill spirits, distillation, distillation equipment, distillation of alcohol, distillation unit, distilled ethanol, distilled spirits, distilled whiskey, distilleries, distillery, distillery equipment for sale, distillery for sale, distilling, distilling at home, distilling at house, distilling equipment, distilling liquor, distilling machine, distilling moonshine, distilling spirits at home, distilling supplies, distilling vodka, distilling water, distilling water at home, distilling wine, DIY, DIY KIT, do it yourself, Do you even lift?, ebay moonshine stills, essential oil, essential oils, home brewing, home distilled water, home distillery, home distilling, home distilling kit, home distilling supplies, home distilling supply, homemade moonshine still, how to build your own still, how to make moonshine still, liquor, liquor still, liquor stills, list essential oils, make booze at home, make moonshine still, make your own, make your own essential oils., make your own liquor, make your own liquors, memes, mens, moonshine, moonshine distillery, moonshine distilling, moonshine still, moonshine still for sale, moonshine still how to make, moonshine still kits, moonshine stilling, moonshine stillmoonshine stills for sale, moonshine stills, moonshine stills for sale, mooonshine, reflux still plans, reflux stills, Shine, SoftSpun Cotton, spirit stills for sale, stainless steel stills, stickers, still distillation, still distillations, still moonshine for sale, stills, stills for salealcohol still, survivalist, survivalists, the copper still company, where can i buy a moonshine still, whiskey still, whiskey stillmoonshine distilling, whiskey stills, whiskey stills for sale, wine making\n\n--- Flash Sale 20 Gallon Advanced Model With 6 Gallon Thumper  6 Gallon  Worm  and 1/2 inch coil ---\nDescription: 20 Gallon Advanced Model With 6 Gallon Thumper 6 Gallon Worm and 1/2 inch Coil\nFREE SHIPPING TO CONTINENTAL USA -  PRICE INCLUDES THE SHIPPING COST\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS UNIT COMES WITH THE STAINLESS EZ SEAL CAP AND 4 INCH FRUIT PORT ON THE THUMPER.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHand-crafted By Experts In The USA\n\n\nShips Fully Assembled No Soldering Required, unlike a moonshine kit \n\n\nIncludes Everything You Need: Pot, Cap, Thumper, Worm, and Temperature Gauge\n\n\nProfessional Grade Copper, Built To Last A Lifetime\n\n\nWater Tested, No Leaks Guaranteed \n\n\nLifetime Warranty \n\n\n\nThe Best Stills On The Market\n\nAmerican Copper Works is proud to produce top-quality, hand-crafted stills.

Open your box.\n2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n9. MASH=  Fermented Materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, ‘cause it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL. \n \n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAmerican Copper Works operates 5 locations across the east coast located in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA who builds moonshine stills and ships them world wide.  If you are close to one of these states please let us know if you want to receive your order from our shops in NH, TN, KY, NC, or GA.  We are happy to offer you the service of customer pick up but also a more personalized and custom order experience.  Please reach out directly to our sales representative and ask for more information by calling  1-502-337-3944 and pressing 1.   We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.

The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n \n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n \n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n \n9. MASH= Fermented materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\n \nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, ‘cause it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n \n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n \n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n \n13. Your Thumper will ll up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n \n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \n \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL.\n \n\nShipping\n\nFree Shipping to Continental USA.  Worldwide Shipping Available. \n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType: DIY KIT\nVendor: American Copper Works\nURL: https://moonshine-stills-com.com/products/50-gallon-ez-kit-you-solder-copper-moonshine-kit\nVariants:\n  - 50 Gallon: $849.00 (SKU: EZkit-50) - Out of Stock\nTags: 1 gallon still, 10 gallon still for sale, 15 gallon copper moonshine still, 2 gallon still, 2 gallon stills, alcohol distillery equipment, alcohol distller, alcohol still kit, alcohol stills, amazon moonshine still, American Made Still, aromatherapy oils, brew moonshine, brewing beer, Bro, build your own brew, build your own kits, build your own stills, buy moonnshine still, cheap copper still, cheap moonshine stills, coper moonshine still, copper, copper moonshine still, copper moonshine stills, copper still, copper still moonshine, copper stills, copper stills for moonshine, copper whiskey still, cotton, craft distillery, craft distilling, dabs, distill mash, distill spirits, distillation, distillation equipment, distillation of alcohol, distillation unit, distilled ethanol, distilled spirits, distilled whiskey, distilleries, distillery, distillery equipment for sale, distillery for sale, distilling, distilling at home, distilling at house, distilling equipment, distilling liquor, distilling machine, distilling moonshine, distilling spirits at home, distilling supplies, distilling vodka, distilling water, distilling water at home, distilling wine, DIY, DIY KIT, do it yourself, Do you even lift?, ebay moonshine stills, essential oil, essential oils, home brewing, home distilled water, home distillery, home distilling, home distilling kit, home distilling supplies, home distilling supply, homemade moonshine still, how to build your own still, how to make moonshine still, liquor, liquor still, liquor stills, list essential oils, make booze at home, make moonshine still, make your own, make your own essential oils., make your own liquor, make your own liquors, memes, mens, moonshine, moonshine distillery, moonshine distilling, moonshine still, moonshine still for sale, moonshine still how to make, moonshine still kits, moonshine stilling, moonshine stillmoonshine stills for sale, moonshine stills, moonshine stills for sale, mooonshine, reflux still plans, reflux stills, Shine, SoftSpun Cotton, spirit stills for sale, stainless steel stills, stickers, still distillation, still distillations, still moonshine for sale, stills, stills for salealcohol still, survivalist, survivalists, the copper still company, where can i buy a moonshine still, whiskey still, whiskey stillmoonshine distilling, whiskey stills, whiskey stills for sale, wine making\n\n--- Flash Sale 50 Gallon Advanced Model Complete Copper Distiller with 10 Gallon Thumper 10 Gallon Worm ---\nDescription: 50 Gallon Advanced Model Copper Moonshine Still -  4 to 6 Weeks to Ship\nFREE SHIPPING TO CONTINENTAL USA -  PRICE INCLUDES THE SHIPPING COST\nTHIS UNIT COMES WITH THE STAINLESS EZ SEAL CAP AND 4-INCH FRUIT PORT ON THE THUMPER.\nExperience the power and capacity of our 50 Gallon Advanced Model Copper Still — hand-crafted by experts in the USA and designed for serious distillers.\n✅ Ships Fully Assembled — No soldering required, unlike traditional moonshine kits.✅ Complete Setup — Includes Pot, Cap, Thumper, Worm, and Temperature Gauge.✅ Professional Grade Copper — Built to last a lifetime.✅ Water Tested — Guaranteed leak-free.✅ Lifetime Warranty — We stand by our craft.\n\nWhat Can You Do with a 50 Gallon Still?\nThe better question is — what can’t you do?

Open your box.\n2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n9. MASH= Fermented materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, because it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n13. Your Thumper will fill up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n \nAmerican Copper Works operates 5 locations across the east coast located in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA who builds moonshine stills and ships them world wide.  If you are close to one of these states please let us know if you want to receive your order from our shops in NH, TN, KY, NC, or GA.  We are happy to offer you the service of customer pick up but also a more personalized and custom order experience.  Please reach out directly to our sales representative and ask for more information by calling  1-502-337-3944 and pressing 1.   We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you. Our units can be upgraded with an ez seal cap on the pot as well as a 4 inch port on the thumper.  These two add ons are optional and not mandatory.  These two add ons make your unit more efficient and effective.  The easy seal cap makes it so you don’t need to apply wheat or flour paste on the pot to seal it every time.  You wont need to clean up any messy paste because you will have a food safe silicone gasket and a stainless steel butterfly clamp and 4 inch stainless ferrule added on the top of your pot.  This way you can seal your unit for the distillation process by a clamping system instead of the old school paste method.  Sealing it this way is highly efficient.  You can also add on the 4 inch port on the thumper as well.  It’s the same set up, 4 inch tri clamp, 4 inch gasket, 4 inch stainless ferrule and 4 inch stainless cap but this time it’s installed on the top of the thumper so you can infuse different flavors into your product.  Having the 4 inch port added on to the thumper also makes it a lot easier to clean the thumper when you decide to run different flavors through the distiller.  If you see the words “top end” model on any of our websites, that is the model with the ez seal cap and 4 inch port on the thumper.  If you want to make sure your order has these add ons or any other custom requests please call 1-502-337-3944 and press 1.  We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.\n \nLIFETIME WARRANTY.  Completely Made in USA.

Open your box.\n2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side.\n3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot.\n4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.\n\n5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin fittings to the left side of the thumper.\nA) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.\n\n \n6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.\n\n7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it.\n8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor.\n9. MASH= Fermented Materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still.\nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY MOONSHINE RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n \nYou are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, because it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us.\n10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil.\n11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out.\n12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product.\n13. Your Thumper will ll up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch.\n14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.  \nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL.\n \n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Copper Works operates 5 locations across the east coast located in NH, TN, KY, NC, and GA who builds moonshine stills and ships them world wide.  If you are close to one of these states please let us know if you want to receive your order from our shops in NH, TN, KY, NC, or GA.  We are happy to offer you the service of customer pick up but also a more personalized and custom order experience.  Please reach out directly to our sales representative and ask for more information by calling  1-502-337-3944 and pressing 1.   We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.

The benefits of owning a distiller outweigh the fact you can make some great liquor. Moonshine is essentially the same thing as ethanol gas. There’s so much they don’t want us to know and I am here to help us all. Time is something I have always tried to master. Saving time is saving money and saving money means more fun or safety for yourself and your family.\nI can proudly announce that as of today, march 27th 2020 Our PATENTED flame flow technology has saved our roughly 400 flame flow model customers around 28,000 minutes. This equals roughly 466 hours or 19 days in saved time. This is time that can be used to spend more time prepping your run, more time on your other hobbies, or more importantly spending more time with your friends and family.\n\nOur units can be upgraded with an ez seal cap on the pot as well as a 4 inch port on the thumper.  These two add ons are optional and not mandatory.  These two add ons make your unit more efficient and effective.  The easy seal cap makes it so you don’t need to apply wheat or flour paste on the pot to seal it every time.  You wont need to clean up any messy paste because you will have a food safe silicone gasket and a stainless steel butterfly clamp and 4 inch stainless ferrule added on the top of your pot.  This way you can seal your unit for the distillation process by a clamping system instead of the old school paste method.  Sealing it this way is highly efficient.  You can also add on the 4 inch port on the thumper as well.  It’s the same set up, 4 inch tri clamp, 4 inch gasket, 4 inch stainless ferrule and 4 inch stainless cap but this time it’s installed on the top of the thumper so you can infuse different flavors into your product.  Having the 4 inch port added on to the thumper also makes it a lot easier to clean the thumper when you decide to run different flavors through the distiller.  If you see the words “top end” model on any of our websites, that is the model with the ez seal cap and 4 inch port on the thumper.  If you want to make sure your order has these add ons or any other custom requests please call 1-502-337-3944 and press 1.  We also accept text messages on this line so please text us about our products and communicate to us what we can build for you.\n\nLIFETIME WARRANTY.  Completely Made in USA.

Open your box. 2. Place pot on a table with temperature gage towards left hand side. 3. Take the smallest piece of the thumper with drain plug facing towards you and put to the right of the pot. 4. Take the worm which is attached to coil and put to the right of the thumper.  5. Take the cap and insert it to the top of the pot, the bottom of the cap connects by spinning the spin FIttings to the left side of the thumper. A) The seam on the top of cap should interlock with seam of the back of the pot.    6. When connecting the spin fitting, if they should leak, use thread locking tape or wheat paste. The unit also comes with an adapter piece which is copper, and it connects to the top of right hand side of the thumper and goes to the worm spin fittings accordingly.  7. Congratulations! You have successfully assembled your Moonshine Still but you still need to know how to use it. 8. You need a burner or any source of flame, you could also have a submerged heating element. Once you have a burner and propane you need some MASH. Mash is what you put in the still to get liquor. 9. MASH= Fermented materials that can range anywhere between 1% to 35% ABV (Alcohol By Volume). The higher the ABV, the more alcohol you will be able to pull out. The goal is to take out as much alcohol out of the mash with your Moonshine Still. \nVISIT: WWW.MASH.RECIPES FOR SOME EASY RECIPES TO GET STARTED.\n You are going to need a Hydrometer, which measures the alcohol content of the Mash, ‘cause it’s always nice to know what your alcohol is in the beginning and the end of the process. There are two different types of Hydrometers, one to use for low proof (of Mash) and one for high proof. Visit our accessory page to purchase more items from us. 10. Strain Mash for any hard materials and pour into pot. You are going to need to seal the cap of the pot with “old school” Wheat Paste or Black Electrical Tape, make sure to seal the unit well. The thumper is a double purification unit, it is not a necessity. We want you to run the Thumper dry (meaning, do not add anything in it) until you know what you are doing. All our units are interchangeable, which means you can take the Thumper out and run it directly from the pot to the worm with the coil. 11. Your Worm, the one with the coil, needs constant ow of cool water (we recommend continuously filling it with ice) you can also get an upgraded Thumper and Worm Kit with any of our units which will give you 2 hoses to run water in and out. 12. Put a flame underneath the Pot until the unit starts to “work”; as soon as the Worm is dripping product, write the temperature down then add 20 degrees to it, “That is your Operating Range”. Always keep still within this range to make sure H2O does not go into your product. 13. Your Thumper will ll up with Liquid and eventually stop the distillation process. You will need to disregard the Thumper’s content or save and re-run in your next batch. 14. Do Not just go and start drinking what comes out of the unit. Please do the appropriate amount of research to make sure you disregard the appropriate amount of your distillate before drinking.\n \n\nNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY USE YOUR NEW MOONSHINE STILL.\n \nShipping\nFree Shipping to Continental USA.  Worldwide Shipping Available. \nDelivery\nPlease allow 1 to 2 Weeks to Ship the Unit.\nURL: https://moonshine-stills-com.com/pages/instructions\n\n--- Moonshine Stills For Sale ---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Copper Works@Gmail.com\n \nWhat is a Distillation Unit, and Why Should You Buy One?\n\nUtilizing Mother Natures different boiling points, you can separate pure alcohol from water.  No, you are not God….You are a Home Moonshiner.\n\n\nDistillation is a great hobby, and much like brewing beer, its easy enough for anyone to use a distillation unit safely.  Save yourself money by making your own consumables.  Liquor, Distilled Water, Essential Oils are just some of great products you can make in the comfort of your own home by purchasing a distilling unit from the best in the business, Home Moonshiners Inc.\n\n A great survival tool that you can keep in the shed in case of an emergency.  You should buy a distillation unit for the sake of protecting yourself and your family from a natural disaster.

Is it safe to drive a car?  Is it safe to drive a car blindfolded?  Is it safe to run a moonshine still without watching it?  Life is not a joke, you can get seriously hurt by not doing the proper research.  Home Moonshiners Inc. is here to answer any and all questions and concerns about your still, before, during and after you use it. \n\n\nYou also need to be careful what you are putting inside of your body, rule of thumb is the first 1/3rd of the first jar gets disposed of and is not to be drank.  Do your research or call us for help.  If you are making essential oils and using moonshine to extract THC from Pot in our stills you need a solid bottom so please ask us for it.  We have yet to have anyone seriously hurt themselves with our units, however, please remember that using a moonshine still is not safe and you should use your highest levels of caution.\n \nWhy Buy From Home Moonshiners Inc.?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2013, ACW has been putting all of their effort into improving the product while still keeping costs in mind.  We make all of the correct folds and seams.  We put an embossing line on the top and bottom of the pieces for structural support.  Our Thumpers and Worms are oversized and good enough for up to a 30 gallon unit in case you ever want to upgrade. \n\nYou can stick your arm right down inside our stills with ease and our units have the temperature gage at the top of the pot where its supposed to be.  Our Craftsmen are highly trained and we do not accept just anyone to work with us.  Our copper is thicker than the other guys, 20 oz. 22 gage. Is standard in our shop. Lead free materials. We are all about freedom.  We want to help save the planet with our stills.  We want to give the people the power to make their own gas. \n\n\n\n\nOur customer service is far superior than the competitors.

Make sure the cap is sealed, you can use old school wheat or flour paste. \n\nIts easy to make and dries rock hard.  Then you let the process work through.  As soon as she starts to drip out of the part all the way to the right, write the temperature down on a piece of paper that the temp gage is showing.  Then, add 20 degrees to it.  That is your operating range. \n\nAlways keep your unit between those temperatures and you are distilling!  You need a hydrometer to measure your finished product, and don’t forget to discard the first 1/3rd of the first run. These are all of the things you need to start distilling at home.  There are many more accessories you could purchase to further your craft, but, start with this stuff and everything else is extra. How Is The Product Made At Home Moonshiners Inc.?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Our Moonshine Stills are designed with customer satisfaction in mind.  The Copper is the purest copper we can get our hands on.  We buy it direct from Paul Revere.  The Copper comes in 3ft x 10 ft sheets and the get placed on our cutting table at our shop in Manchester New Hampshire.  Our highly skilled craftsman accurately measures and cuts each piece needed to build the correct sized moonshine still.  Once the piece is cut, the piece is then moved over the bending station. \n\n\nThe piece is the bent and folded over 180 degrees.  We do this for added structural integrity as well as to reduce the risk of the customer cutting themselves while maneuvering our product.  All of our edges are folded over and none of the edges are sharp.  Once the edges are folded over, the piece is ready to get put through the rolling machine.  This machine rolls the sheet copper into a cylindrical shape.  Once inspected, the piece is then moved over to the embossing station.  The craftsman accurately embosses the piece which will leave the part ready to clamp and solder.   \n\nBefore we clamp and solder we ensure we have all of the other pieces needed, like the circles for the bottoms, the cones, the tubing kits, the fittings, the coil, and the unit is placed on the table for the copper smith to build the product, by hand.  The pot body gets installed to the cone, which gets installed to the cap.  The hole is drilled on the right side of the cap for the lyne arm to get inserted.  The lyne arm travels down at a 45 degree angle and connects to the thumper using a spin union.  The tubing travels through the thumper on the left side almost all the way down to the bottom and is cut at a 45 degree angle for maximum efficiency while distilling.  Coming out of the thumper, the tubing continues its way towards the worm which is the final piece to the moonshine still. \n\n\nBefore getting to the worm there is another spin union.  This is placed there to make it easy to take the thumper out and run the pot directly to the worm.  All of our units are interchangeable.  Once we get to the worm we focus on installing the coil.  The condensing coil is the final process for the steam which is traveling through the moonshine still.  We install two hose hook ups on the right side of the worm so the customer can run water in and out to continuously be able to run fresh water through the worm for maximum cooling power.  The pot size advertised is the capacity of the pot.  The lyne arm is 1 inch diameter.  The tubing for the rest of the unit is ½ inch.  The coil for the condenser is 3/8 of an inch.  All of our thumper and worms are 9x9 and 9x 11 inches respectively.   It took us years to perfect not only our processes and procedures but our product and packaging.  Everything down to the way we clean the copper after each time it gets hot to keep the copper as clean and as pure as possible. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Copper?\n\n Copper has been being used for hundreds of years for a reason.  Copper makes your liquor taste better.  Home Moonshiners Inc. uses the highest quality copper available, from America.  20 Oz. 22 Gaga thickness is standard in our shop.  We do not use the thin 16 oz. stuff like the other guys do.  You get the highest quality shine when using our copper pots, thumpers worms and caps.  Nothing makes a traditional Appalachian moonshine still shine brighter than a copper still the same style the old timers used back in the day.  \n\n\nCopper is widely used in all areas of distillation, even commercial distilleries.  Here are some of the reasons why copper is far superior than stainless steel moonshine stills and why it makes your liquor taste so good.  Copper reacts with alcohol on a molecular level. Producing a chemical reaction, removing the sulfur compounds resulting naturally from fermenting yeast.  Sulfur is not good for your liquor and if its in there, you will be able to taste it.  Copper gets the sulfur out!   Copper not only makes your shine taste better, it also helps heat up the still more consistently.  Copper is a great thermal conductor which makes it a great material to build a moonshine still out of.  Perfect for fast heat up and also easily condensing the vapors.\n\nAmazingly, copper has proven antimicrobial effects. Copper kills bacteria and viruses.  Copper makes your liquor taste better.  A steel still is easier to clean, but don’t you want cleaner liquor?  Some people just drink to get drunk, others drink because of the overall experience.  Don’t take our word for it, try both and see for yourself!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Do I Heat The Moonshine Still?\nOur units can get heat up via direct propane flame, or , it can get heated up with an electric heating element. Both work well, however, you need to make sure your heat is strong enough.  Rule of thumb is for a 2 gallon still you can use any hot plate.  For a  6 gallon you can use a 110v submerged heating element. For a 10 gallon or bigger you would want to use a 220v submerged electric heating element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Would I Buy A Moonshine Kit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Moonshiners Inc..·MONDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Moonshiners Inc. offers Moonshine Kits which give the customer the ability to build a distillation unit from the comfort of his or her own home.

Our sharp model is sharp, you could cut yourself, so watch out! The Sharp model will make the same quality moonshine than our other models. You may be asking yourself, why are we going to offer a “Sharp” model anyways. Well, we have been building copper moonshine stills since 2012 and we have had hundreds of phone calls come in and ask, “why would we buy your unit for $500, when vengeance stills is at $300.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to offer the customers a comparable model. It is very hard to tell what you are buying when buying a still online. Hopefully, we can provide clarity to the subject. For many years we trash talked the sharp style stills online and said that ours were superior, and we still believe it. However, after long sleepless nights, we decided that back in the day, out in the woods, or grandparents and great grand parents didn’t give a shit about folded edges, they wanted moonshine. This, is why we are ok with offering you a “Sharp” Model.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are calling it the “Sharp Model” because we want everyone to know that they are buying a completely separate unit when you compare it to our standard copper stills. Our standard units have all of the bends, folds, embossments to make it stronger and not have sharp edges. Our Sharp Models have sharp edges, no embossing, and no folds on any of the pieces, just like you see from our competitors. We were astonished when we first started building the sharp models because of how fast it was to build them versus our standard style. It is NO WONDER why our competitors like Vengeance Stills and North Georgia Stills have no problem selling $300 moonshine stills, all of the skill to the craft had disappeared!!.\n\n\nOnce again, we were amazed at how fast it was to manufacture a sharp model versus a standard model. Both Models will make the same quality shine, within the same amount of time, you just got to watch out, because she’s “Sharp”. Lets take a look at our competitors to see exactly how they are able to offer a $300 moonshine still to the public and make it seem like its such a great deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Competitors sell Cheaply Priced Units because…..\n\n\n\n\n\n1. The edges are all sharp. They just slap the unit together as fast as they can to keep up with the overwhelming demand of customers wanting affordable priced distillation units. This is great, until the customer receives the unit only to find out that it is incomplete and missing fittings and that you need to solder some pieces on. To us, we call this a kit. A kit is an Incomplete unit. And when you buy a still from our competitors, that is what you receive. They don’t make it easy for you to see, but, if you read the fine print, the lovely $300 moonshine still you are going to buy still needs work to be completed. And, time is money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. 16 oz. copper used versus the 20 oz. copper that everyone else uses. They offer their units at a discounted rate at first, showing an affordable complete still, but, then you find out that its 16 oz. copper which is 25% less thick than the 20 oz. copper. They will try and upsell you for the thicker copper, charging an extra $99 for legit $10 in extra materials.\n\n\nThis is how our competitors are able to offer units that seem like such a great deal. Its is a great deal, until you receive it, and need to go to the hardware store for some fittings which you may or may not find, as well as soldering your unit complete. Testing the unit also takes time which our competitors most likely do not do since their units are In complete. **Also, if you look at their electric elements, sure, they offer electric options, but is it really what you need?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we see is companies offering just the element, which you plug right into the wall, there is no way to control the heat, it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and then when you think the still is hot enough, you unplug it from the wall, then when you want more heat, you plug it back in. It makes sense if you like to waste time and have patience, and its also cheap.\n\n\nOnly $80 versus our standard electric element and controller which costs $250. This has been a huge hurdle for us to explain to the potential customer and we decided, heck, if you cant beat them, join them. Now, we offer that option as well. Inexpensive Stills and Inexpensive Electric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Labor gets saved, copper gets saved, what else gets saved? How come the competitors can offer cheap units but TDN can’t? We took a long hard look at this subject. High end? Or Low end? Folds, or Not. Electric or not. We are always asking our customers questions to make sure we are offering the best products. The bottom line is that the majority of customers entering a new hobby are NOT trying to spend top dollar on something they may not even enjoy. This is why we have introduced the Sharp Model. This unit will be a lot easier to build, it will give the customer the opportunity to enter the market without hurting their pockets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 Oz. Versus 20 Oz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Moonshiners Inc..·SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe copper we use to build our copper stills is 99.9% Pure Copper. 20 oz. versus 16 oz. seems to be the question everyone asks when deciding what thickness of moonshine still to run. 16 oz. is thick enough, but 20 oz. is better. They are both good, and going thicker doesn't necessarily mean that you will run a better still, or a better product. It simply means that your still is thicker and will take longer to heat up..... Personal preference trumps status quo, so you be the judge. Over the years, run different thicknesses and see which ones you like better.\n\nMany people prefer stainless over copper anyways. They mainly choose stainless because it is stronger and easier to clean. You can find 20 Oz. copper stills for sale on our website www.moonshinestills.com which we manufacture in Manchester, New Hampshire, USA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur “WAW” - Wait-a-While Shipping Option Saves You Money.  (Discontinued)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Moonshiners Inc..·THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone knows that “Time is Money”.

We have already cut, bent, rolled and embossed the copper for you to get you started.\n\n\nNow it’s up to you to rise up to the challenge.\nHow rewarding would it be to be able to BRAG to all your friends and family that you actually built a Copper Moonshine Still yourself! Or better yet, build it with the help of a friend or family member as a quality time project.\n\n\nWe included this BooKitLet (yeah, that’s what we called this awesome thing) with very detailed instructions on how to get your Still ready to rock. How- ever you decide to tackle this, we promise you that you will not be alone along the way, we are just a phone call away if you have questions!\n\n(502) 337-3944\n\n\n\nWe also have an instruction video on  for you to follow along as well.\n\n\n\nSo, turn to the page with a list of Tools Needed and get ready to build your own Copper Moonshine Still!\n\nGood Luck.\n\n\nKITS INSTRUCTIONS\nPARTS INCLUDED:\n\n \n\n TOOLS NEEDED\n\n* Gloves and eye goggles\n\n* Metal Snips for Custom Cuts\n\n* Small Ball Hammer\n\n* Metal File for Sharp Edges\n\n* Propane Torch Head\n\n* Propane tank (small, disposable)\n\n* Fire Extinguisher and other safety supplies\n\n* Long Flat Head Screwdriver\n\n* Step Drill Bit\n\n* Deburring Tool (if needed)\n\n* Anything made of metal to hold up the bottom of the pot from the inside Or a 5 Gallon bucket lined with tin foil\n(to hold circle bottom piece into place when ﬁtting it)\n\n* Clamps to hold the seams together when soldering (Have different length sizes on hand)\n\n* Tin Foil\n\n\n\n\nPot Body Assembly\n\nThe Pot has two sides of the seam: a sharp side and a tucked seam side.\n\nThe Sharp side goes on the inside of the pot, it tucks under the folded over side.\n\n\n\n\n\nApply ﬂux to the sharp seam on the outside and to the folded over side to the inside (the ﬂux sides will touch when you fold them over). Clamp the seams together on the folded over seam.\n\n\nOur mission here is to clamp the pot to the correct size of the bottom circle.\nClamp the pot so the circle ﬁts snug, you want it on the tighter side rather than loose. This is important, please remember copper is soft and you will want it tight, so the solder makes a connection.\n\n\nStart soldering inside the pot seams. Use the heat and follow with the solder, you’ll heat up the copper to melt the solder.\n\nGo slow, making sure the solder drips into the gaps of the seam. Your ﬁrst run of soldering is to ﬁll the gaps, you will do a second run along the seam to make it look good.\n\nInsert the pot circle and use something to push the circle up from the inside, as to keep it in place while you solder the circle. Same as with the pot seams solder slowly; making sure there are no gaps, circle has to be snug.\n\n\n\n\nLet it Cool and take the clamps off.\n\n\n\n\nThumper comes with two copper circles. One of these circles has two drilled holes; this one is the top circle. Same as the pot, insert bottom circle and solder.\n\nTurn over and insert the top, use a tool to pull up the edges to solder nice and ﬂat.IF YOU ARE HAVING AN ISSUE YOU SHOULD CALL US OR WATCH THIS VIDEO \n\n \nCap Kit Assembly\n\nClamp and solder the open cylinder (cap bottom) just as you did with the pot body. The bottom piece of the Cap has two lines, a beveled line and an embossed line. Embossed line is under beveled line.\n\n\nFlux the seams of Cap Top and Bottom; Insert the Cap top on Bottom with beveled line on top, match the seams as these interlock. Get the tightest ﬁt you can, ﬂux seams again and start soldering as you did with the pot.\nMake Two runs of solder inside the cap pieces (you can always do a small solder line on the outside for added security).\nIncluded is a ﬂat square of copper, this is your Cap Tip Top; you can cut this into a circle to ﬁt the cap top.\nUsing the top piece of the cap as a guide, draw a circle with marker on the inside to make a stencil of the right size.\n\n\nCut the circle shape, leaving about a 1/8” extra when you cut, this will help make sure the circle you cut is not too small for the cap. Fit the circle into the top of Cap Kit, use something inside to drive the circle up and keep it in place while you solder (any metal cylinder would work).\nFlux the seams along circle and solder.\n \n\nCONE ASSEMBLY\n\n\nAs we saw with the pot body, the Cone also has two sides: a sharp side and a folded over side. The folded over side is always on the outside, covering the sharp edge side.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlux the sharp side of the seam on the side facing towards you, ﬂux the seam of the folded over side as well, just as we did with the pot.\nMatch the bottom of cone seams ﬁrst and when you fold the seams over each other, leave about 2” overhang on the bottom and about ¼” on top to be able to ﬁt the clamps (Don’t clamp the seam, you will be soldering the seam).\n\nClamp the top and bottom and use a longer handle clamp to clamp the middle of the cone, we do not want any gaps. Close the gap well so the copper sides are touching each other.\n\n\nFlux and solder from the inside, make sure to ﬁll the gaps well with the solder. Solder in two runs: the ﬁrst run is to ﬁll the gaps well; the second run is to make it look nice and even.\nWait for the solder to cool, remove clamps.\n\nFor this step, you will need an object such as a metal stand, metal object or a 5 gallon bucket lined with tin foil (to prevent melting), this will help you hold the cone into place while you insert the pot body and solder.\nFlip cone upside down on the bucket (holder) and ﬁt the pot into the cone and\nmatch up the seams.\nApply pressure to the top of the pot before soldering, to make gaps tighter. (you may want to have another person pushing down to make sure gaps are tight, or you can use a weight as well).\n\n\nFlux along the seam of Cone and Pot and solder, go slow, in 3” stretches.\n DID YOU WATCH OUR VIDEO YET?  \n\nAssembly Cap to Cone\n\nJust as we did with the Pot to Cone assembly, attach Cap to small end of cone making sure the seams match (these should interlock).\n\nHave someone help you keeping into place, or have something holding the Cap in place (make sure whatever you use keeps the two pieces steady!)\n\n\nFlux and solder leaving no gaps. Use low heat, do not overheat and do not force the solder into the seams. Make it so the solder ﬂows naturally and the ﬂame and the ﬂux do all the work.\n \n\n\nWorm Assembly\n\nSame process as with the Pot’s Body.\nFit bottom circle onto the worm’s body, ﬂux and solder.\n\n\n\nThe top circle of worm will have two holes, use a tool to get the top circle up so you can solder in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlugs and Bushings\n\nYou’ll need to drill the holes (unless they are already drilled).\nIt is best to use a step drill bit; make sure you do not over drill the hole, you want the piece to ﬁt snug. Try to use the threads of the piece you are installing to make it ﬁt tight.\n\n\nWhen you heat up these pieces, it is different that heating the copper up and soldering! You need to heat up the piece slightly longer before applying the solder. If you apply the solder before the brass piece is hot enough to take the solder, you will end up with solder drips on the copper.\n\n\n\n\nAll these pieces will be in the box. The plug and bushing go on the thumper or anywhere you would like to install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThumper Pipe Instructions\n\nThe seam is on the back side, the drain plug is on the front. Once you de- termine which side is the front and back, you then need to make sure the correct tubing gets installed. The long tubing goes almost all the way down on the left side. The tubing that does not go down much at all goes on the right side.\n\n\nPlumbing the Unit\n\nOnce all of your pieces are ready to get installed, you need to line everything up on the table and get it nice and straight before you solder everything up. We call this “Plumbing the Unit”.\nMaking sure everything lines up before soldering the pipes is important to ensure that your unit looks proper.\n\nMake sure you apply enough ﬂux to all joints before soldering. Hold the ﬂame on the ﬁtting and heat it up until solder takes. Do not wait too long or the solder won’t take. If this happens, use sand paper or wire brush to clean up and reﬂux, let it cool down before you try to solder again.\n\n\nWorm Calibration\n\nThe coil for the worm needs to be installed in a manner where the coil spirals downwards.\nThe coil cannot be spiraling from low to high or down too ﬂat.\n\n\nMake sure when installing the coil, the ﬂow of the spiral goes downwards to ensure the correct ﬂow needed.\n\n\nTips and Tricks\n \n\nClamping \n\n* Clamping the copper is important when building a copper moonshine still; the tighter you clamp the copper, the less solder you will have to use and a much stronger bond will be created.\n* When clamping, make sure you use the clamps with ﬂat ends which pivot this way you won’t be left with marks on your moonshine still.\n* Flux pieces before clamping and before soldering. The ﬂux cleans and prepares the area for maximum adhering capabilities.\n\nSoldering\n\n\n\n* Flux the pieces generously to ensure proper solder bondings; the solder should “Mend” into the copper.\n* Use ﬂux to cool certain spots down if needed.\n* Go slow when soldering, do not overheat the ﬂux or copper and let the solder mend naturally with the copper sheet.\n\n\nMake sure you ﬁll all seams with solder. We like to go until it drips out the other end and use gravity to your advantage!\n\n\n* Always start from the bottom (side close to you) and run the solder up the seams. Put the ﬂame ﬁrst and follow with the solder, let the copper melt the solder instead of the ﬂame.\n* Solder in Two Runs. First run is meant for the solder go into the seams. Second run is to make it look nice and ﬁnished. Flux in between runs, but let it cool off ﬁrst!\n*Before you do a “Second Run”, hold the ﬂame on left hand side of seam and\nyou’ll see the solder bubble. If there is space for the solder to move, it will move.\n*Wrap your clamps with tin foil to avoid solder drippings on your clamps.\n \nCHECK OUT OUR MOONSHINE KITS FOR SALE\n \n \n\nContact Us!\n\nCall or Text Us With Questions at: (502) 337-3944 \n \nShipping\nFree Shipping to Continental USA.  Worldwide Shipping Available. \nDelivery\nPlease allow 1 to 2 months to ship the unit.\nMAKE SURE YOU WATCH THIS VIDEO \n\n\n \nURL: https://moonshine-stills-com.com/pages/moonshine-stills-plans\n\n=== BLOG POSTS ===\n\n--- CLEANING YOUR STILL, COPPER OR STAINLESS ---\nBlog: BEGINNERS ARCHIVE\nAuthor: Moonshiner Chuck\n\n\nWhen it comes to cleaning stills, believe it or not, it's relatively simple.
